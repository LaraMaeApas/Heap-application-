# Title:   Task Scheduler Using Min-Heap

# Introduction:

This is a simple Java console application that demonstrates the use of a heap data structure. 
The application allows users to manage and prioritize tasks effectively using a min-heap, where the smallest (highest priority) element is always at the root.

# Features:
•	,Add tasks with a name and priority (or deadline).
•	Display all tasks sorted by priority.
•	Remove the highest-priority task.
•	Practical for organizing personal tasks or project deadlines.

# Why this application was created
We created this application to learn the practical implementation of heap data structures and their benefits in real-world scenarios. 
A heap is an essential data structure for tasks like scheduling and resource allocation. It contributes to the community by demonstrating how data structures can solve everyday problems efficiently.

# How it contributes
The Task Scheduler using Min-Heap improves productivity by prioritizing tasks efficiently.
It showcases the practical use of heap data structure
